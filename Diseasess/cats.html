        Cancer is a class of diseases in which cells grow uncontrollably, invade surrounding tissue and may spread to other areas of the body. As with people, cats can get various kinds of cancer. The disease can be localized (confined to one area, like a tumor) or generalized (spread throughout the body).

        <button onclick="can_pre_fun()" id="can_more_pre">PREVENTION</button>
        <p><span span id="can_tre">Treatment options vary and depend on the type and stage of cancer.<br></br>
            Common treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation and immunotherapy or a combination of therapies. Success of treatment depends on the form and extent of the cancer and the aggressiveness of the therapy. Of course, early detection is best.<br></br>
            Some cat owners opt for no treatment of the cancer, in which case palliative care, including pain relief, should be considered. Regardless of how you proceed after a diagnosis of cancer in your pet, it is very important to consider his quality of life when making future decisions.<br></br>
            Some cancers can be cured, and almost all patients can receive at least some benefit from treatment. Please note that if your cat's cancer is not curable, there are still many things you can do to make your pet feel better. Don't hesitate to talk to your vet about your options. And remember good nutrition and loving care can greatly enhance your cat's quality of life.</span></p>

        <h2><b>DIABETES</b></h2>
        <div class="container">
        <p>Common symptoms of diabetes in cats are:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Change in appetite (either increased or decreased).</li>
        <li>Weight loss.</li>
        <li>Excessive thirst/increase in water consumption.</li>
        <li>Increased urination.</li>
        <li>Urinating in areas other than litter box.</li>
        <li>Unusually sweet-smelling breath.</li>
        <li>Lethargy.</li>
        <li>Dehydration.</li>
        <li>Unkempt hair coat.</li>
        <li>Urinary tract infection.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span span id="di_ab">Diabetes in cats is a complex disease caused by either a lack of the hormone insulin or an inadequate response to insulin. After a cat eats, her digestive system breaks food into various components, including glucose which is carried into her cells by insulin. When a cat does not produce insulin or cannot utilize it normally, her blood sugar levels elevate. The result is hyperglycemia, which, if left untreated, can cause many complicated health problems for a cat.</span></p>
        <button onclick="di_abt_fun()" id="di_more_abt">ABOUT</button>
        <p><span span id="di_pre">A proper diet and regular exercise can go a long way to avoid the development of feline diabetes. Aside from other negative effects, obesity is known to contribute to insulin resistance.</span></p>
        <button onclick="di_pre_fun()" id="di_more_pre">PREVENTION</button>
        <p><span span id="di_tre">Every diabetic cat is an individual and will respond differently to therapy. Diabetes treatment is based on how severe the signs of disease are and whether there are any other health issues that could complicate therapy.<br></br>
            Some cats are seriously ill when first diagnosed and require intensive hospitalized care for several days to regulate their blood sugar levels.<br></br>
            Cats who are more stable when first diagnosed may respond to oral medication or a high-fiber diet.<br></br>
            For most cats, insulin injections are necessary for adequate regulation of blood glucose. Once your pet's individual insulin treatment is established, typically based on weight, you will be shown how to give him his insulin injections at home.<br></br>
            Your vet may also show you how to perform glucose tests at home. Other routine blood work may also be necessary.</span></p>

            <p>Common symptoms of worms in cats are:</p>
            <ul> 
            <li>Diarrhea.</li>
            <li>Worms visible in stool or segments of worm seen near anus.</li>

            <li>Trouble breathing.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><span span id="wo_ab">Cats can acquire a variety of intestinal parasites, including some that are commonly referred to as 'worms'.Infestations of intestinal worms can cause a variety of symptoms. Sometimes cats demonstrate few to no outward signs of infection, and the infestation can go undetected despite being a potentially serious health problem. Some feline parasitic worms are hazards for human health as well.<br></br>
                Outdoor cats and those who are routinely exposed to soil where other animals defecate are prone to worms. Kittens and cats who do not receive regular preventative health care are most at risk for developing complications associated with internal parasites.
                <br></br>
                Common Types of Worms in Cats:
                <br></br>
                Roundworms are the most common internal parasites in cats. Resembling spaghetti, adult worms are three to four inches long. There are several ways cats can become infected. Nursing kittens can get roundworms from an infected mother's milk, while adult cats can acquire them by ingesting eggs from the feces of an infected cat.<br></br>
                Hookworms are much smaller than roundworms -less than an inch long-and reside primarily in the small intestine. Because they feed on an animal's blood, hookworms can cause life-threatening anemia, especially in kittens. Hookworm eggs are passed in the stool and hatch into larvae, and a cat can become infected either through ingestion or skin contact.<br></br>
                Tapeworms are long, flat, segmented parasites that range from 4 to 28 inches in length. An infestation can cause vomiting or weight loss. Cats acquire tapeworms by ingesting an intermediate host, like an infected flea or rodent. When cats are infected, tapeworm segments-actual pieces of the worm that resemble grains of rice-can often be seen on the fur around a cat's hind end.<br></br>
                Lungworms reside in the lungs of a cat. Most cats will not show any signs of having lungworms, but some can develop a cough. Snails and slugs are popular intermediate hosts of this type of parasite, but cats are usually infected after eating a bird or rodent who has ingested an intermediate host.<br></br>
                Though means of transmission can vary, one of the main ways that cats get worms is through the ingestion of the feces of infected felines. Mother cats can also pass on worms to their kittens.

                Make sure your home, yard and pets are flea-free.<br></br>
                Practice good hygiene and wear gloves when changing cat litter or handling feces. It is also important to frequently dispose of stool.<br></br>
                Ask your veterinarian to recommend an appropriate internal parasite treatment or prevention program for your cat.</span></p>

            <p><span span id="wo_tre">Please don't attempt to treat your pet yourself,your cat should be treated for the specific type of worms he has.
                Not all dewormers eradicate all types of worms. Your veterinarian will determine the type of worm(s) infestation(s) your cat has, and prescribe the best course of treatment. Your veterinarian will also be able to tell you if the dewormer should be repeated, and when.
                Not all dog medications are safe for cats.
                Some over-the-counter deworming medications can be harmful if used inappropriately.</span></p>

            <div class="container">
            <p>Symptoms of FIV in cats are:</p>
            <p>An FIV infected cat may not show any symptoms for years. Once symptoms do develop, however, they may continually progress or a cat may show signs of sickness interspersed with health for years. If your cat is demonstrating any of the following symptoms, please have examined by your veterinarian:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Enlarged lymph nodes.</li>
            <li>Fever.</li>
            <li>Anemia.</li>
            <li>Weight loss.</li>
            <li>Disheveled coat.</li>
            <li>Poor appetite.</li>
            <li>Diarrhea.</li>
            <li>Abnormal appearance or inflammation of the eye (conjunctivitis).</li>
            <li>Inflammation of the gums (gingivitis).</li>

            <p><span span id="fiv_ab">Cats infected with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) may not show symptoms until years after the initial infection occurred. Although the virus is slow acting, a cats' immune system is severely weakened once the disease takes hold. This makes the cat susceptible to various secondary infections. Infected cats receiving supportive medical care and kept in a stress-free, indoor environment can live relatively comfortable lives for months to years before the disease reaches its chronic stages.</span></p>
            <button onclick="fiv_abt_fun()" id="fiv_more_abt">ABOUT</button>
            <p><span span id="fiv_pre">The best way to prevent your cat from contracting the virus is to keep him indoors, avoiding any chance of contact with infected felines.
                If you walk your cat, keep him on a leash when outdoors.
                If your cat is going to be spending any time in a cattery or in a home with other felines, make sure all cats have tested negative for FIV.
                Any recently adopted cat should be tested for FIV prior to entering your home.
                You may also want to speak to your veterinarian about the FIV vaccine and if it is appropriate for your cat.</span></p>
            <button onclick="fiv_pre_fun()" id="fiv_more_pre">PREVENTION</button>
            <p><span span id="fiv_tre">Unfortunately, there is no specific antiviral treatment for FIV. Cats can carry the virus for a long time before symptoms appear. Therefore, treatment focuses mainly on extending the asymptomatic period or, if symptoms have set in, on easing the secondary effects of the virus. Your veterinarian may prescribe some of the following treatments:

                Medication for secondary infections
                Healthy, palatable diet to encourage good nutrition
                Fluid and electrolyte replacement therapy
                Anti-inflammatory drugs
                Immune-enhancing drugs
