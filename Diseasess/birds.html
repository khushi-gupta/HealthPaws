            <h2><b>PROVENTRICULAR DILATION DISEASE (PDD)</b></h2>
            <div class="container">
            <p>Symptoms of PDD are:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Weight loss.</li>
            <li>Vomiting.</li>
            <li>Changes in the bird's droppings and a swollen crop, which is the muscular pouch near the throat.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, no one sign or symptom can distinguish PPD. Some birds may not show any signs of illness until they are very sick with the disease.</p>
            <p><span span id="pd_ab">Proventricular Dilatation Disease (PDD) is one of the most confounding avian disorders. The disease affects the nerves that supply the bird's gastrointestinal tract, though it can also affect nerves that supply other organs, too.
            
            PDD is also known as Macaw Wasting Syndrome and Parrot Wasting Syndrome because it's most commonly diagnosed in Macaws, African grey parrots, Amazon parrots, cockatoos, and conures.</span></p>

            <p><span span id="pd_tre">Treatment will often be nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and the bird may have to be put on a special diet. However, there's no cure for the disease, so these treatments are just to reduce pain for the rest of the birds' lives.</span></p>

            <p>Symptoms of parrot fever are not specific but may include:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Difficulty in breathing.</li>
            <li>eye infections and inflammation, as well as loose, watery droppings.</li>

            <p><span span id="pf_ab">Psittacosis, or "Parrot Fever," is a form of the Chlamydia bacterium that can affect all hookbills. The disease is highly contagious and can be passed from birds to other animals, as well as humans.</span></p>

            <p><span span id="pf_pre">Keep cages clean; clean cages and food and water bowls daily.<br></br>
                Position cages so that food, feathers, and droppings cannot spread between them (i.e., do not stack cages, use solid-sided cases or barriers if cages are next to each other).<br></br>
                Avoid over-crowding.<br></br>
                Isolate and treat infected birds.</span></p>

            <p><span span id="pf_tre">Treatment is most often an antibiotic, tetracycline, which can be given orally or through injections. However, birds taking tetracycline cannot have calcium because of its effect on the medication.</span></p>
