        <h2><b>CANCER</b></h2>
        <div class="container"> 
        <p>Symptoms of cancer in dog are:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Lumps (which are not always malignant, but should always be examined by a vet).</li>
        <li>Swelling.</li>
        <li>Persistent sores.</li>
        <li>Abnormal discharge from any part of the body.</li>
        <li>Bad breath.</li>
        <li>Listlessness/lethargy,sudden lameness.</li>
        <li>Rapid, often unexplained weight loss.</li>
        <li>Black, tarry stools (a symptom of ulcers, which can be caused by mast cell tumors).</li>
        <li>Decreased or loss of appetite.</li>
        <li> Difficulty breathing, urinating or defecating.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span span id="can_ab">Cancer is a class of diseases in which cells grow uncontrollably, invade surrounding tissue and may spread to other areas of the body. As with people, dogs can get various kinds of cancer. The disease can be localized (confined to one area, like a tumor) or generalized (spread throughout the body).</span></p>

        <p><span span id="can_pre">Having your dog altered at a young age can dramatically reduce their chance of getting certain types of cancer.
            Breast cancer can be avoided almost completely by having your dog spayed before her first heat cycle, while a neutered male dog has zero chance of developing testicular cancer.</span></p>
        <button onclick="can_pre_fun()" id="can_more_pre">PREVENTION</button>
        <p><span span id="can_tre">Treatment options vary and depend on the type and stage of cancer.<br></br>
            Common treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation and immunotherapy or a combination of therapies. Success of treatment depends on the type and extent of the cancer and the aggressiveness of the therapy. Of course, early detection is best.<br></br>
            Some dog owners opt for no treatment of the cancer, in which case palliative end of life care, including pain relief, should be considered. Regardless of how you proceed after a diagnosis of cancer in your pet, it is very important to consider his quality of life when making future decisions.<br></br>
            Some cancers can be cured, while others cannot. Please note that if your dog's cancer is not curable, there are still many things you can do to make your pet feel better. Do not hesitate to talk to your vet about your options. And remember good nutrition and loving care can greatly enhance your dog's quality of life.</span></p>

        <h2><b>DIABETES</b></h2>
        <div class="container">
        <p>Syptoms of diabetes in dogs are:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Change in appetite</li>
        <li>Excessive thirst/increase in water consumption</li>
        <li>Weight loss</li>
        <li>Increased urination</li>
        <li>Unusually sweet-smelling or fruity breath</li>
        <li>Lethargy</li>
        <li>Dehydration</li>
        <li>Urinary tract infections</li>
        <li>Vomiting</li>
        <li>Cataract formation, blindness</li>
        <li>Chronic skin infections
        </ul>
        <p><span span id="di_ab">It is important to understand that diabetes is considered a manageable disorder and many diabetic dogs can lead happy, healthy lives.
            <br></br>
            Diabetes can be classified as:
            <br></br>
            Type I (lack of insulin production)
            <br></br>
            Type II (impaired insulin production along with an inadequate response to the hormone).
            <br></br>
            The most common form of the disease in dogs is Type I, insulin-dependent diabetes, which occurs when the pancreas is incapable of producing or secreting adequate levels of insulin. Dogs who have Type I diabetes require insulin therapy to survive.</span></p>
        <button onclick="di_abt_fun()" id="di_more_abt">ABOUT</button>
        <p><span span id="di_pre">Although a certain form of diabetes -the type found in dogs less than a year of age is inherited, proper diet and regular exercise can go a long way to avoid the development of diabetes. Aside from other negative effects, obesity is known to contribute to insulin resistance.</span></p>
        <button onclick="di_pre_fun()" id="di_more_pre">PREVENTION</button>
        <p><span span id="di_tre">Every diabetic dog is an individual and will respond differently to therapy.
            Diabetes treatment is based on how severe the signs of disease are and whether there are any other health issues that could complicate therapy.<br></br>
            Some dogs are seriously ill when first diagnosed and require intensive hospitalized care for several days to regulate their blood sugar levels.<br></br>
            Dogs who are more stable when first diagnosed may respond to oral medication or a high-fiber diet that helps to normalize glucose levels in the blood.<br></br>
            For most dogs, insulin injections are necessary for adequate regulation of blood glucose. Once your pet's individual insulin treatment is established, typically based on weight, you will be shown how to give him his insulin injections at home.<br></br>
            Spaying your dog is recommended, as female sex hormones can have an effect on blood sugar levels.</span></p>

          <h2><b>HEART WORM</b></h2>
          <div class="container">
            <p>Syptoms of heartworm in dogs are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Labored breathing</li>
                <li>Coughing</li>
                <li>Vomiting</li>
                <li>Weight loss, listlessness and fatigue after only moderate exercise</li>
                <li>Some dogs exhibit no symptoms at all until late stages of infection</li>
            </ul>
           <p><span span id="hw_ab">Heartworm is a parasitic worm that lives in the heart and pulmonary arteries of an infected animal. The worms travel through the bloodstream, harming arteries and vital organs as they go,ultimately completing their journey to the vessels of the lung and the heart chamber about six months after the initial infection. Several hundred worms can live in one dog for five to seven years.</span></p>
           <button onclick="hw_abt_fun()" id="hw_more_abt">ABOUT</button>
           <p><span span id="hw_pre">Heartworm is easily preventable with an inexpensive, chewable pill or topical medication available as a vet's prescription. The pills or topical are usually administered monthly and can be given to dogs under 6 months of age without a blood test. Older animals must be screened for the disease prior to starting medication.<br></br>
            The American Heartworm Society recommends keeping your dog on the medication all year long. Not only does this avoid errors, but many of the products also prevent other intestinal parasites.</span></p>
           <button onclick="hw_pre_fun()" id="hw_more_pre">PREVENTION</button>
           <p><span span id="hw_tre">After diagnosis, a thorough examination of the infected dog should be conducted to evaluate the best course of treatment and the potential risks involved.
            <br></br>
            The most common course of treatment is a series of injections of drugs called adulticides into the dogs' muscle. This cure has a high success rate and usually requires hospitalization.
            All treatment protocols require several weeks of exercise restriction after treatment and are not without risk. Disease prevention is a much better and safer option.
            After treatment, your dog should be placed on a preventative medication to reduce the risk of infection.</span></p>

          <h2><b>RINGWORM</b></h2>
          <div class="container">
            <p>Syptoms of ringworm in dogs are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Skin lesions that typically appear on the head, ears, paws and forelimbs.</li>
                <li>Ringworm can patchy, crusted, circular bald spots that sometimes look red in the center.</li>
                <li>In mild cases, there may be just a few broken hairs, while bad cases can spread over most of a dog's body.</li>
                <li>It is also possible for a pet to carry the fungus and not show any symptoms whatsoever.</li>
            </ul>
           <p><span span id="rw_ab">Although the name suggests otherwise, ringworm is not caused by a worm at all,but a fungus that can infect the skin, hair and nails. This highly contagious disease can lead to patchy areas of hair loss on a dog and can spread to other animals and to humans, too.</span></p>
           <button onclick="rw_abt_fun()" id="rw_more_abt">ABOUT</button>
           <p><span span id="rw_pre">Most owners don't have to worry about ringworm prevention on a regular basis unless they have already had a case of ringworm in one or more pets. The best ways to prevent reinfection of ringworm in dogs are to fully cleanse the environment of the home and any tools and bedding that the animals regularly come into contact with, and to follow the instructions of your veterinarian.
            <br></br>
            Knowing the symptoms of ringworm in dogs can help you prevent the spread of ringworm from dogs to people or other pets. For more information about ringworm or if you suspect that your dog might have ringworm, contact your veterinarian.</span></p>
           <button onclick="rw_pre_fun()" id="rw_more_pre">PREVENTION</button>
           <p><span span id="rw_tre">Treatment of ringworm depends on the severity of the infection.
            <br></br>
            A veterinarian may prescribe a shampoo or ointment that contains a special medication to kill the fungus.<br></br>
            In some cases, oral medications are necessary.<br></br>
            It is important to treat your dog for as long as recommended by your veterinarian.<br></br>
            Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that reinfection won't occur.
            If your veterinarian has diagnosed your dog with ringworm, he or she will explain what you must do to prevent the fungus from spreading to your other pets and to the human members of the household. But keep in mind that if you have other pets, it is likely that most of them have been exposed as well. Your veterinarian may recommend that you do the following:
            <br></br>
            Bathe all pets in the household with a medicated rinse or shampoo.
            Wash the infected animals' bedding and toys with a disinfectant that kills ringworm spores.
            Discard items that are impossible to thoroughly disinfect (carpeted cat trees, etc.)
            Frequently vacuum to rid the house of infected hairs and skin cells. (Yes, the fungus can survive on hair and skin that your dog sheds!)
            Thoroughly wash your hands after you bathe or touch your cat.</span></p>
